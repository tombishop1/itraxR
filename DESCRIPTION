Description: Parse, trim, join, visualise and analyse data from Itrax sediment core multi-parameter 
    scanners manufactured by Cox Analytical Systems, Sweden. Functions are provided for parsing 
    XRF-peak area files, line-scan optical images, and radiographic images, alongside accompanying metadata. 
    A variety of data wrangling tasks like trimming, joining and reducing XRF-peak area data are simplified. 
    Principle component analysis (PCA), cluster analysis and associated multivariate methods are 
    implemented with appropriate data transformation.
